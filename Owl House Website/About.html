			<h2>About</h2>
				<p><em>The Owl House</em> is an animated Disney show created by Dana Terrace. The series premiered on January 10, 2020 on Disney Channel. The entire first season is currently available on Disney Plus.</p>

After some time being there, she begins to change the people and world around her for the better.</p>
		 
			<h2>Season 1 Rundown</h2>

				<p>From left to right, the four glyphs are known as the Light glyph, Ice glyph, Fire glyph, and Plant glyph. To activate glyphs, Luz can either tap the paper that they were drawn on or she can activate them from a distance using Eda's staff. The light glyph produces a little ball of light. The plant glyph can produce plants. The fire glyph produces fire and can melt objects. The ice glyph produces ice. Currently, not much is known about glyphs.</p>
